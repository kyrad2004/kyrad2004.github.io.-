          <td class="answer">The educational equity gap refers to the disparities in educational outcomes and opportunities across intersectionalities (race, gender, socioeconomic status, etc.). This gap is present in grades, test scores, dropout rates, and enrollment rates in higher education. </td>

          <td class="answer">This gap will continue to grow overtime and will have lasting affects on schools, families, and communities. It is important that all students are given the opportunity for a quality education and are equipped with life skills to obtain higher educations if desired.</td>

          <td></td>
          <td class="answer">Minorities and BIPOC are often impacted by the equity gap. This disparity exists in many areas due to redlining and the current funding system. <b>Redlining</b> is the term used to describe the "types of historic race-based exclusionary tactics in real estate..." (New York Times). Neighborhoods were ranked from least risky to most risky, and often times, the most risky neighborhoods were where majority of African Americans lived. This practice limited where many could live, and those in the risky zones were sent to underperforming schools.</td>

          <td class="answer">This can be helped by checking in on students, teaching new skills to students, maintaining academic rigor, introducing new opportunities, writing to representatives, hiring more qualified teachers, and even raising distict awareness to these ongoing issues.  </td>
